    "Each conference is further divided into four division of four clubs and every NFL team is based in the contiguous United States. Since the analysis including all the teams right-away was estimated to be computationally intensive, Liang was asked to develop a preliminary analysis for a subset of teams, namely for teams in the East, North, and South divisions. This setup was agreed by the NFL schedulers to approximate the overall problem sufficiently well to come up with recommendations. Figure 1 shows all the 24 teams that are included in the analysis."
